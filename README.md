While new technologies have changed almost every aspect of our lives, the construction field seems to be struggling to catch up. Currently, the structural condition of a building is still predominantly manually inspected. In simple terms, even nowadays when a structure needs to be inspected for any damage, an engineer will manually check all the surfaces and take a bunch of photos while keeping notes of the position of any cracks. Then a few more hours need to be spent at the office to sort all the photos and notes trying to make a meaningful report out of it. Apparently this a laborious, costly, and subjective process. On top of that, safety concerns arise since there are parts of structures with access restrictions and difficult to reach. To give you an example, the Golden Gate Bridge needs to be periodically inspected. In other words, up to very recently there would be specially trained people who would climb across this picturesque structure and check every inch of it.

Fortunately, nowadays in cases with accessibility issues UAVs, such as drones, are deployed to take photos but still, a person would have to spend hours and hours checking each and every photo taken for signs of damage.

Here is where our work comes to revolutionize the inspection process. Artificial Intelligence takes the lead, and more specifically, Deep Learning by training our machines to be able to replace the human in the tedious task of detecting cracks on photos of structures.

There are three levels of crack detection from photos:

¬∑ The image is divided into patches and each patch is assigned a crack or non-crack label

¬∑ A rectangle is drawn around any detected crack

¬∑ Each pixel is labelled as crack or non-crack

While Deep Learning methods for crack detection have been widely studied for concrete surfaces or asphalt, little research has been done on vision-based assessment and specifically for defect detection applied to brick masonry surfaces. As part of my PhD study with my supervisors, we attempted to bridge this gap. The focus of our work is the detection of cracks on photos from masonry surfaces both on patch and pixel level. More details on our research can be found in our open access Journal paper [1]. Codes, data, and networks relevant to the implementation of the Deep Learning models can be found on my GitHub Repository [2].

Dataset preparation
The most important part of training a Deep Learning model is the data; the accuracy of a model heavily relies on the quality and amount of data. The better the representation of the real world the higher the chances of the model to be able to accurately work on real structures. Inarguably, the surface of masonry is less homogeneous and significantly noisier as compared to concrete or asphalt. Also, there are no available datasets of photos with cracks on masonry surfaces. To address the lack of data, I looked up in the Internet for any relevant photos while at the same time I took my camera and captured all the cracks in the centre of Groningen!

A common criticism over developed Deep Learning methods is that they attain remarkable results when tested on monotonous backgrounds, but their accuracy severely drops when deployed on images with complex backgrounds. Objects such as such as windows, doors, ornaments, labels, lamps, cables, vegetation etc. can be characterized as noise for the crack detection process and the network needs to learn to negate them to accurately detect cracks. Therefore, when taking photos such objects were intentionally included as well.

As a result, an extensive dataset was prepared from photos of masonry structures containing complex backgrounds and now we are ready for the next step: training the Deep Learning model.

Regarding crack detection on patch level, different state of the art CNNs pretrained on ImageNet were examined herein for their efficacy to classify images from masonry surfaces on patch level as crack or non-crack. The considered networks were: VGG16, MobileNet, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, ResNet34, and ResNet50. The best results were obtained with the pretrained MobileNet, a lightweight network destined to run on computationally limited platforms. In particular, the pretrained MobileNet scored accuracy 95.3% while when no pretraining was considered the accuracy dropped to 89.0%.


Confusion matrix obtained with the MobileNet (Dais et al, 2021)
For the crack segmentation U-net and Feature Pyramid Networks, a generic pyramid representation, were considered and combined with different CNNs performing as the backbone of the encoder part of the network [3]. The CNNs used as the backbone are the networks that were previously used for patch classification. Furthermore, DeepLabv3+, DeepCrack, and FCN based on VGG16, networks that were successfully used in the literature for crack segmentation were examined as well in an extensive comparative study.

U-net-MobileNet (U-Net as base-model with MobileNet as backbone) and FPN-InceptionV3 (FPN as base-model with InceptionV3 as backbone) attained the highest F1 score, that is 79.6%. The original implementation of U-net and U-net-MobileNet without pretraining reached similar F1 score, that is 75.7% and 75.4% respectively. Therefore, using a pretrained network as the backbone boosts the F1 score by approximately 4%. Again, transfer learning seems to do the trick!

Datasets for crack segmentation are characterized by severe class imbalance i.e. the background class occupies the greatest part of photos while cracks extend over limited pixels. Due to this imbalance, if special measures are not taken, the network tends to become overconfident in predicting the background class which could lead to misclassifications of cracks and numerous false negatives. To overcome this, different loss functions were examined. The weighted cross entropy loss function, which allows the network to focus on the positive class by up-weighting the cost of a positive error, outperformed the rest.


The original image, the ground truth and the prediction with U-net-MobileNet (Dais et al, 2021)
Conclusions
With our research we showcased that the modernization of the construction sector and specifically of the inspection process is possible. Of course, these new technologies have unlimited possibilities only to be revealed with further research.

For the time being we collect additional data, further develop the crack detection process, and combine it with 3D scene reconstruction to automatically register cracks and take metric measurements.
